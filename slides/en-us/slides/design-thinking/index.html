              If you ask a typical developer what step #1 of a new project is, chances are good that they'll say something like, "Pick a web framework" or "Set up a new code repository".
            </p>
            <p>If you ask a fan of Design Thinking what step #1 of a new project is, they'll say, "Empathy". Putting yourself in the mindset of the user. Understanding what they want to accomplish when they use your app. </p>
            <p>Because if you start writing tests in the language of the user, it helps you think like a user. And then, it opens up creativity in an entirely different part of your brain. "Hmmm, if I buy tomatoes every week, wouldn't it be cool if I could just re-purchase last week's shopping cart full of the food I normally buy?" "I'm already uploading a pre-written shopping list to my cart for my automated unit tests -- I wonder if it would make my users lives easier if they could do the same thing?"</p>
